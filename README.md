# Squares -A new game by James O'Toole

This was made because I wanted to tap squares. The first step was to make remake some of my old engine. I never achieved scaling on resize or good sound implementation. I also had issues with game logic & FPS.

## Now

* Game Logic funs 60 times a second, fixed. This allow me to avoid the game running super fast on high res screens. Not sure how this will go for animiation. It will mean I have to smoothly animate drawing, else positions will be locked to 60fps I think.. Interesting, Lets see
* Squares I can tap
* Using this sound lib.
